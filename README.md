# Instagram Bot

Designed as a rapid prototype for a client to show proof of concept, this Instagram bot allows users to grow an engaged audience through automated targeted following 
and post engagement. The user can specify a particular hashtag they wish to engage with or simply specify a related account with a similar audience. The bot will 
then automatically follow users and or interact with posts based on the specified inputs, being careful to evade Instagram's stringent bot detection filters by randomly varying time intervals.

During testing, this very bot was used to grow an undisclosed business's new and niche Instagram account to over 3000 engaged followers within several weeks. 
This helped to drive traffic to their ecommerce store whilst simultaneously improving brand awareness.





### Real-World Use-Cases

üí≤ Digital marketing through traffic funneling and lead generation

üè¶ Automate menial tasks associated with growing an audience on Instagram



### Development-Goals

üß∞ Develop deeper understanding of complex web page elements 

ü§ñ Improve Selenium library knowledge






## Built With

* [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)


## Future work

Due to the dynamic nature of Instagram's forever updating desktop website, ceratin bot functions may begin to fail over time due to the static nature of how the bot intereacts with, and identifies, web page elements.
By generalising Selenium web page element selection, rather than selecting specific elements by XPath's, the above problem may be mitagated. Making the bot more Instagram update-proof
